    <h2>A Letter From the Governing Body</h2>

    <h4>Dear Lovers of Jehovah:</h4>

    <p>The year was 1971. Those who attended the “Divine Name” District Assembly held that year were thrilled to receive
        several new publications. The publications were described as “just beyond anyone’s imagination.” Concerning one of
        those new releases, a brother said: “It’s the most exciting preview of things to come that we have ever had!” What
        was he referring to? It was the book entitled “The Nations Shall Know That I Am Jehovah”​—How? But why did this
        book create such excitement? Because it contained updated explanations of the prophecies found in the Bible book of
        Ezekiel​—prophecies that affect the future of all mankind.</p>
    <p>In the years since the release of the ‘Know Jehovah’ book, the number of God’s people has mushroomed​—from some 1.5
        million to well over 8 million. (Isa. 60:22) These millions of servants of Jehovah collectively speak over 900
        different languages. (Zech. 8:23) Many have never had an opportunity to study a book that explains in detail the
        inspired prophecies recorded by the prophet Ezekiel.</p>
    <p> Additionally, in the decades since 1971, our understanding of many Bible truths has been greatly enhanced as the
        light has continued to grow brighter. (Prov. 4:18) In 1985 we started to see clearly how the “other sheep” are
        declared righteous as friends of God. (John 10:16; Rom. 5:18; Jas. 2:23) Then in 1995 we understood for the first
        time that the final judging of “the sheep” and “the goats” would take place during the coming “great tribulation.”
        (Matt. 24:21; 25:31, 32) All these adjustments have had an impact on our understanding of the book of Ezekiel.</p>
